paragraph = """The question we writers are asked most often, the favorite question, is: Why do you write?
I write because I have an innate need to write. I write because I canâ€™t do normal work as other people do.
I write because I want to read books like the ones I write. I write because I am angry at everyone.
I write because I love sitting in a room all day writing.
I write because I can partake of real life only by changing it.
I write because I want others, the whole world, to know what sort of life we lived, and continue to live,
in Istanbul, in Turkey. I write because I love the smell of paper, pen, and ink.
I write because I believe in literature, in the art of the novel, more than I believe in anything else.
I write because it is a habit, a passion. I write because I am afraid of being forgotten.
I write because I like the glory and interest that writing brings.
Perhaps I write because I hope to understand why I am so very, very angry at everyone."""
